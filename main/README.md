# MAIN: Frozen Lake

This is the primary code for the "Frozen Lake" project. It consists of regular Python code, meant to be run as an integrated package. Each file (except `CONTEXT.py`) is prefixed with `Qi_`, where `i` is a placeholder for the question number corresponding to the question that outlines the particular tasks to be carried out in the code. The files in this package are as follows:

- `CONTEXT.py`
- `Q1_environment.py`
- `Q2_tabularModelBasedMethods.py`
- `Q3_tabularModelFreeMethods.py`
- `Q4_nonTabularModelFreeMethods.py`
- `Q5_deepReinforcementLearning.py`
