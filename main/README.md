# MAIN: Frozen Lake

This is the primary code for the "Frozen Lake" project. It consists of regular Python code, meant to be run as an integrated package. Each file is prefixed with `Qi_`, where `i` is a placeholder for the question number corresponding to the question that outlines the particular tasks to be carried out in the code. The files in this package are as follows:

- `Q1_environment.py`
- `Q2_tabularModelBasedMethods.py`
- `Q3_tabularModelFreeMethods.py`
- `Q4_nonTabularModelFreeMethods.py`
