- Final report based on conceptual knowledege and practical results
- Individual reflection, i.e. a report on individual contributions

The final report contains the following:

- Answers to conceptual questions
- Reports and plots on the results from the various RL methods implemented
- Optimisation of parameters for SARSA control and Q-learning
- Implementation notes
