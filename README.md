# _Frozen Lake_:<br>Reinforcement Learning Project
This project aims to use reinforcement learning principles to create algorithms to find policies that would help us better navigate the "Frozen Lake" environment defined within this project.

## Question 1: Environment
Implementation of `FrozenLake` environment, which involves:

- Implementation of state-action transition probability function `p`
- Implementation of state-action transition reward function `r`
- Modication of `step` function to consider the chance of slipping

## Question 2: Tabular Model-based Methods

- Policy evaluation function `policy_evaluation`
- Policy improvement function `policy_improvement`
- Policy iteration function `policy_iteration`
- Value iteration function `value_iteration`
